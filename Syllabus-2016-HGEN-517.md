#### OVERVIEW  
HGEN 517 will introduce students to a modern workflow for performing reproducible research using R, a free and open source programming language developed for statistical computing.  

The **NIH** has recently highlighted the need to address the issue of **reproducibility in science reporting** and how to enhance **transparency**. Grant applications will now be expected to describe the process to be used to ensure the rigor of the proposed research. This issue is compounded for **genomic research** that involves a complex pipeline of procedures and **R** not only streamlines this process but is often the only option.  

Practical and hands-on lectures will demonstrate how R can be used to manage research projects, manipulate and analyze data, and create reports/presentations and manuscripts that are dynamic, transparent and reproducible. The overall goal of this course is to provide students with an appreciation of the benefits of using R for data analysis and enough experience to begin adopting these methods in their own work. Lectures will provide the fundamentals for efficient handling and exploration of common data set structures in the biomedical sciences. All lecture sessions will be hands-on and problem driven.

#### STUDENTS
Students will be introduced to a data analysis workflow that can greatly improve the efficiency and reproducibility of their research. R has become the *de facto* tool for data science and this approach to research has been embraced by top institutions like Johns Hopkins, Harvard, Vanderbilt and Rice, as well as major technology companies like Microsoft, Google and Facebook. As such, these skills are in great demand: *R Programming* and *The Data Scientist's Toolbox* are presently among the most popular courses available on [Coursera](http://www.coursera.org).  

This course is targeted to all School of Medicine graduate students. Prerequisite include an undergraduate or graduate level introduction to statistics course. No computer programming experience is required.  

<br>

#### TEXT  
There is no required text. There are several on-line R tutorials including the one found in the [Cran-R](https://cran.r-project.org) site. A good textbook reference is: Data Analysis and Graphics in R, Maindonald and Braun, Cambridge University Press  

Students will need to bring their laptop to each class. Let Dr. York know if you do not have access to a laptop.  

<br>

#### ASSESSMENT
Evaluation will be based on completion of **project assignments** (3x20 points each), **daily quizzes** (30 points) and **participation** (10 points).  As instruction for this course is hands-on and interactive, attendance is required. Students will be allowed one unexcused absence. Final grades will be reduced by 7 points for each additional unexcused absence. Requests for approved absences should be made 24 hours in advance to Dr. York.
